# library

As usual, I take a few liberties with my interpretation of this project. I don't see why 'read' should be a parameter in the constructor function, if there is going to be a checkbox for it.

I found it difficult to make the input form for new books look nice. I guess I don't know where to put it on the page to make it look nice. 

Looking forward to seeing how other people handled that. 

I didn't see how this project helped us learn about prototypes, though.
